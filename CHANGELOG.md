# Changelog

All notable changes to Compendium will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Typed state reload on `IProcessManagerRepository`.** New
  `Task<Result<IProcessManager<TState>>> GetByIdAsync<TState>(Guid id, ct)` overload
  rehydrates a saga's persisted state into the original typed shape so resumed steps
  can detect already-completed external work (the foundation for idempotent saga
  retries). Implemented for `PostgresProcessManagerRepository`
  (deserializes the existing `state_json` column) and `InMemoryProcessManagerRepository`
  (returns the original instance, with a `Conflict` error on type mismatch).
  Existing untyped `GetByIdAsync(Guid id, ct)` is unchanged.

### Fixed

- `Compendium.Adapters.Zitadel.ZitadelOrganizationIdentityProvisioner` now treats
  the "user already exists" conflict from Zitadel as a recoverable state. When
  `IUserService.CreateUserAsync` returns `ErrorType.Conflict`, the provisioner
  falls back to `GetUserByEmailAsync` and reuses the existing user id for the
  org-membership step. Without this, every subsequent organization provision
  for the same admin email left an orphan Zitadel org behind and stuck the
  upstream Nexus aggregate in `Provisioning` state. Other failure types
  (validation, unauthorized, network) still propagate as before.
- `Compendium.Adapters.Zitadel.ZitadelOrganizationIdentityProvisioner` now also
  treats "resource already exists" conflicts on the Organization, Project, and
  OIDC App creation steps as recoverable, mirroring the user-conflict handling
  already in place. On Conflict for org/project, the provisioner falls back to
  a lookup by name and reuses the existing id. For OIDC apps, the provisioner
  fails fast with `Zitadel.OidcAppExistsButSecretLost` because the client
  secret is only returned once by Zitadel and cannot be safely re-derived from
  a lookup. Operators must manually rotate the OIDC secret in Zitadel and
  re-run provisioning. Without these changes, every retry of a saga that got
  past the user step but failed later left orphan Zitadel resources behind.
  Adds `IOrganizationService.GetOrganizationByNameAsync` to the public
  identity-abstractions surface so consumers can implement the same idempotent
  pattern against other identity providers.

### Added

- **AI agent loop primitives.** New `Compendium.Abstractions.AI.Agents` namespace
  introduces `IAgent`, `IAgentToolRegistry`, and the supporting models
  (`AgentRequest`, `AgentResult`, `AgentTurn`, `AgentTool`, `AgentToolInvocation`,
  `AgentLoopOptions`, `AgentTerminationReason`). The default
  `Compendium.Application.AI.Agents.StandardAgent` implements a ReAct-style loop
  on top of any `IAIProvider`: tool descriptions and an action grammar are
  rendered into the system prompt, and the agent parses an `\`\`\`action` JSON
  block out of each response to dispatch tool calls through the registry. Works
  with any chat-capable model, no native tool-calling format required.
- `ReActPromptBuilder` and `ReActActionParser` are exposed publicly so callers
  can build custom agents that share the same grammar.
- New sample `samples/04-AI-Agent` demonstrates a two-tool loop end-to-end and
  ships a scripted offline provider so it runs without an API key.
- `ProjectionOptions.BackfillFromBeginningOnEmptyCheckpoint` (default `false`).
  Controls the cold-start behaviour of `LiveProjectionProcessor` when no
  projection has a persisted checkpoint:
  - `false` (legacy default) — jump to the current head of the event stream.
    Avoids replaying weeks of events on every restart.
  - `true` — start from position 0 and replay every event. Required when
    projections are the *only* writers to the read model; without it the read
    model stays empty and never catches up to the event store.
  Once any projection persists a checkpoint, that checkpoint takes over and
  this option is ignored.

### Notes

- `Compendium.Application` now references `Compendium.Abstractions.AI` so
  `StandardAgent` can sit in the application layer without forcing every
  consumer to add the project reference manually. No transitive contract change
  for existing CQRS / Saga / Idempotency users.

## [1.0.0-preview.4] - 2026-04-27

### Changed

- **Projections can now use DI dependencies.** `IProjectionManager.RegisterProjection<T>()`,
  `IProjectionManager.RebuildProjectionAsync<T>()`,
  `ILiveProjectionProcessor.RegisterProjection<T>()`, and
  `ServiceCollectionExtensions.AddProjection<T>()` no longer require
  `where TProjection : IProjection, new()`. Projections are resolved through the
  injected `IServiceProvider`, so any constructor dependency (logger, connection
  string, cache, metrics) is supported. Existing parameterless projections keep
  working as long as they are registered in DI; `AddProjection<T>()` now uses
  `TryAddSingleton<T>()` to register them automatically. Resolves #35.

### Added

- **Saga pattern, two flavors clearly separated.** Compendium now ships two
  distinct saga abstractions so users don't have to guess which kind they're
  using:
  - `Compendium.Abstractions.Sagas.ProcessManagers` — **DDD orchestration saga**
    (Vaughn Vernon's "Process Manager"): a stateful coordinator that groups
    aggregate operations inside one bounded context. Includes
    `ProcessManager<TState>` base class, `ProcessManagerOrchestrator`, and
    in-memory + PostgreSQL repositories.
  - `Compendium.Abstractions.Sagas.Choreography` — **Event-driven saga**:
    `IHandle<TEvent>` handlers, `IChoreographyRouter`, `IChoreographyContext`
    with correlation/causation propagation, `[Compensation]` metadata.
- `Compendium.Adapters.PostgreSQL.Sagas` — `PostgresProcessManagerRepository`
  with auto-schema creation, JSONB state snapshot, multi-tenant aware.
- DI helpers: `services.AddProcessManagers()`,
  `services.AddEventChoreography(...)`, and
  `services.AddPostgreSqlProcessManagerRepository(...)`.
- `docs/sagas.md` — decision tree, side-by-side comparison, migration guide
  from the deprecated `ISaga` API.

### Deprecated

- `Compendium.Application.Saga.ISaga`, `ISaga<TData>`, `SagaOrchestrator`,
  `ISagaOrchestrator`, `ISagaRepository`, `ISagaStepExecutor`,
  `ISagaFactory<,>` — kept with `[Obsolete]` for one minor version. The legacy
  API conflated orchestration and choreography; use `IProcessManager` or
  `IEventChoreography` instead. Removal scheduled for v1.0.

## [1.0.0-preview.3] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- Documentation site (DocFX, multi-version, GitHub Pages) (#17).
- 5 Architecture Decision Records (#14).
- Public `ROADMAP.md` (#15).
- Getting-started guide and 3 runnable samples (#20).
- 4 concept pages: event sourcing, hexagonal architecture, Result pattern, multi-tenancy (#21).
- 8 adapter how-to guides (AspNetCore, LemonSqueezy, Listmonk, OpenRouter, PostgreSQL, Redis, Stripe, Zitadel) (#22).

### Changed

- CodeQL Default Setup switched from `default` to `extended` query suite — adds maintainability/quality queries on top of security (csharp + actions).
- Dependabot now skips semver-major bumps on `Microsoft.Extensions.*`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.*`, `Serilog.Settings.Configuration`, and `System.Text.Json` until the project moves to .NET 10 alongside Nexus (#25). Patch and minor bumps continue to flow.

### Security

- Pinned `softprops/action-gh-release` to commit SHA in `.github/workflows/release.yml` (#16, CodeQL `actions/unpinned-tag`, CWE-829, alert #28). 3rd-party action refs are now immutable.

## [1.0.0-preview.2] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- `Compendium.Adapters.Shared` — PII masking utilities used across adapters (introduced in #3).

### Changed

- Dependabot updates: `actions/upload-artifact` 4→7 (#4), `softprops/action-gh-release` 2→3 (#5), `actions/checkout` 4→6 (#6), `actions/cache` 4→5 (#7).
- OSS governance: CODEOWNERS, PR/issue templates, `SECURITY.md`, Code of Conduct, Dependabot config.

### Security

- CI: minimal `permissions:` block on workflows (#1, CodeQL `actions/missing-workflow-permissions`).
- Sanitize user-controlled path in tenant validation logs (#2, CodeQL `cs/log-forging`).
- Remove email from adapter logs for GDPR data minimization (#3, CodeQL `cs/exposure-of-sensitive-information`, 14 alerts closed).
